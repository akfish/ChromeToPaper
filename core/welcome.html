<div>Congratulations! You have the latest version of ChromeToPaper. If this is your first time using this extension on this computer, please visit the <a target="_blank" href="options.html">options page</a> to configure your experience.</div>

<div class="post"><h2 class="posttitle">V2.4.1</h2>
Hi guys! I hope you have had a great New Year thus far. Due to legal issues, I had to change the name and the icon of this extension. I'm not exactly the best icon designer, so please bare with me while I try to get a new icon.<br /><br />
If you have an icon for this extension, email it to jamesmkwan[dot]com[at]gmail[dot]com. The icon has to be square 128x128 png with a transparent background. If you want to create different versions, here are the current stages: (a) Regular Icon (b) Connecting to server [...] (c) Saved site [+1] (d) site (e) auth. <br /><br />
Last but not least, to you extension testers, I am sorry that I have not given out any special new stuff yet. Because of the way the extension gallery works, I need to create a new extension every time I want to make a test, and it is rather troublesome. In addition, I have not had very many feature requests recently.

<br /><br /><b>Coming in V2.5</b><br />
<ul>
<li>Icon Themes (pick what set of icons you want)</li>
<li>Button Behavior (popup menu or one-click add)</li>
</ul>
Let me know if you want any other features!

<div class="post"><h2 class="posttitle">V2.3.1</h2>
Updated for new version of ChromeToPaper Keyboard Shortcuts</div>

<div class="post"><h2 class="posttitle">V2.3</h2>
Recently, I have received several feature requests for my extension that are either somewhat esoteric or downright controversial. Adding these features to my extension would discourage some users from using my extension, so I thought of a workaround.<br /><br />

With this new update, I have created a separate extension that can augment the features of this extension. I proudly present to you <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/anphalfoaaegidcbognealancgeanllm/" target="_blank">ChromeToPaper Keyboard Shortcut</a>! As the name suggests, this extra will enable Keyboard Shortcuts integration with this extension.

<div class="post"><h2 class="posttitle">V2.2:</h2>
The extension user interface has been modified to provide a more unified experience. Extension pages (like this one and the options page) should be more user friendly.

<h2 class="posttitle">V2.1.1</h2>
Due to popular opinion, the Extension Updated Page (this page) no longer pops up immediately after an update. Instead, the icon displays a "msg" badge, which will open the Instapaper Updated Page on click.

<div class="post">
<h2 class="posttitle">V2.1</h2>
Version 2.0 was a huge upgrade which left plenty of room for improvement. One user, 2010 politely informed me that there was no feedback when the extension button is clicked until it is added. Another user, Andre, suggested that clicking the Instapaper button on the new tab page opened the instapaper site. I've accounted for both of these suggestions in this update.

<div class="post">
<h2 class="posttitle">V2.0</h2>
With this breakthrough version, the extension interface has been completely recreated. The classic popup bubble has been replaced with Chrome-style extension badges. In addition, the options page has been heavily modified to accomodate the login.
