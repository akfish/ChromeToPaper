<div class="post"><h2 class="posttitle">V2.3.2</h2>
Hi guys! I hope you have had a great New Year thus far. Due to legal issues, I had to change the name and the icon of this extension. I'm not exactly the best icon designer, so please bare with me through this transition period.<br /><br />
If someone would be so awesome as to help me create an icon (or icon set) and send it to jamesmkwan[dot]com[at]gmail[dot]com, I would be happy to use it. Please make the icon a square 128x128 png with a transparent background. If you want to, you can also make different versions of the icon. The three main versions of the icon would be (a) Regular Icon (b) Connecting to server (c) Saved site<br /<br />
Last but not least, to you extension testers, I am sorry that I have not given out any special new stuff yet. Because of the way the extension gallery works, I need to create a new extension every time I want to make a test, and it is rather troublesome. In addition, I have not had very many feature requests recently.

<div class="post"><h2 class="posttitle">V2.3.1</h2>
Support for the new version of Instapaper Extras: Keyboard Shortcuts has been added. The new version supports the specification of a keyboard shortcut that can open the Instapaper site.
</div>

<div class="post"><h2 class="posttitle">V2.3</h2>
Recently, I have received several feature requests for my extension that are either somewhat esoteric or downright controversial. Adding these features to my extension would discourage some users from using my extension, so I thought of a workaround.<br /><br />

With this new update, support for Instapaper Extras, separate extensions that can augment the features of this extension, has been added. To start the party, I proudly present to you <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/anphalfoaaegidcbognealancgeanllm/" target="_blank">Instapaper Extras: Keyboard Shortcut</a>! As the name suggests, this extra will enable Keyboard Shortcut integration with this extension. Please note that Instapaper Extras are an experimental feature and may contain severe bugs.

<div class="post"><h2 class="posttitle">V2.2:</h2>
The extension user interface has been modified to provide a more unified experience. Extension pages (like this one and the options page) should be more user friendly.
</div>

<div class="post">
<h2 class="posttitle">V2.1.1</h2>
Due to popular opinion, the Extension Updated Page (this page) no longer pops up immediately after an update. Instead, the Instapaper icon displays a "msg" badge, which will open the Instapaper Updated Page on click.
</div>

<div class="post">
<h2 class="posttitle">V2.1</h2>
Version 2.0 was a huge upgrade which left plenty of room for improvement. One user, 2010 politely informed me that there was no feedback when the extension button is clicked until it is added. Another user, Andre, suggested that clicking the Instapaper button on the new tab page opened the instapaper site. I've accounted for both of these suggestions in this update.
</div>

<div class="post">
<h2 class="posttitle">V2.0</h2>
With this breakthrough version, the extension interface has been completely recreated. The classic popup bubble has been replaced with Chrome-style extension badges. In addition, the options page has been heavily modified to accomodate the login.
